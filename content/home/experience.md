        Grew a small machine vision-centric company, while solving industrial part-inspection tasks and scientific research automation challenges.
        
        * Built systems to inspect: Dinnerware, truck brakes, agriculture seeds, optical fiber, mass flow controllers,...
        * Point-cloud 3D laser height mapping, bright & dark field imaging, Area scan cameras, and Conveyor-based line-scan camera systems
        * Oversaw projects, contracts, budgets, sales, small teams, recruitment, and timelines...and other the many hats that come with a small business.
    
    
  - title: Graduate Student Researcher
    company: University of Pennsylvania

    location: Philadelphia, PA
    date_start: '2002-09-01'

        Studied and measured carbon nanotubes using optical, electrical, and thermal measurements, with some electron microscopy and magnetic measurements along for the ride too.  
        Multi-day measurement averaging and mapping of large parameter space required heavy (and robust!) automation. I learned and loved to build control algorithms for collecting and analyzing these data automatically, and got a big kick out of bringing that over to a multi-user facility.
