Dan Milkie is a senior scientist at Janelia Research Campus. Cells did not evolve to live on the glass coverslip nor under the burning intensity of high power lasers. Unlocking what cells and biology are doing *dynamically* and in their *native* environment is key to understanding how complex biologic systems work.  Dan's research interests include advanced light microscopy including super resolution and adaptive optics.  

Dan designs the control hardware and writes the control software for all the Betzig Group microscopes (Lattice Lightsheet, Structured Illumination, Adpative Optics Lattice Lightsheet, 5-objective Opposing Objective Microscope, Cryo-SIM/-PALM), and brings to bear any new technology we can leverage (FPGA, Spatial Light Modulators, Deformable Mirrors, Piezo stage, >GB/s cameras, ).  These microscopy platforms deliver a firehose of data, and brins about  

Dan builds these novel advanced imaging tools, first, for the hands of power users. Then by baking the achieved wisdom into the hardware design and software, the next evolution of the tools pays off with wide impact distribution, commericalization, and use by non-specialists.
