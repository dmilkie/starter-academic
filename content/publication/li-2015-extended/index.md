abstract: "Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is distinct among nanoscale
  imaging tools in its ability to image protein dynamics in living cells.
  Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) stands out in this regard because of
  its high speed and low illumination intensities, but typically offers only a
  twofold resolution gain. We extended the resolution of live-cell SIM through
  two approaches: ultrahigh numerical aperture SIM at 84-nanometer lateral
  resolution for more than 100 multicolor frames, and nonlinear SIM with
  patterned activation at 45- to 62-nanometer resolution for approximately 20 to
  40 frames. We applied these approaches to image dynamics near the plasma
  membrane of spatially resolved assemblies of clathrin and caveolin, Rab5a in
  early endosomes, and alpha-actinin, often in relationship to cortical actin.
  In addition, we examined mitochondria, actin, and the Golgi apparatus dynamics
  in three dimensions."
