abstract: We report thermal conductivity measurements of purified single-wall
  carbon nanotube (SWNT) epoxy composites prepared using suspensions of SWNTs in
  N-N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) and surfactant stabilized aqueous SWNT
  suspensions. Thermal conductivity enhancement is observed in both types of
  composites. DMF-processed composites show an advantage at SWNT volume
  fractions between phi similar to 0.001 to 0.005. Surfactant processed samples,
  however, permit greater SWNT loading and exhibit larger overall enhancement
  (64 +/- 9)% at phi similar to 0.1. The enhancement differences are attributed
  to a ten-fold larger SWNT/solid-composite interfacial thermal resistance in
  the surfactant-processed composites compared to DMF-processed composites. The
  interfacial resistance is extracted from the volume fraction dependence of the
  thermal conductivity data using effective medium theory. [C. W. Nan, G. Liu,
