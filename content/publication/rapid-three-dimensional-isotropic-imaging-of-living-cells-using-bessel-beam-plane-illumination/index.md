abstract: A key challenge when imaging living cells is how to noninvasively
  extract the most spatiotemporal information possible. Unlike popular
  wide-field and confocal methods, plane-illumination microscopy limits
  excitation to the information-rich vicinity of the focal plane, providing
  effective optical sectioning and high speed while minimizing out-of-focus
  background and premature photobleaching. Here we used scanned Bessel beams in
  conjunction with structured illumination and/or two-photon excitation to
  create thinner light sheets (< 0.5 mu m) better suited to three-dimensional
  (3D) subcellular imaging. As demonstrated by imaging the dynamics of
  mitochondria, filopodia, membrane ruffles, intracellular vesicles and mitotic
  chromosomes in live cells, the microscope currently offers 3D isotropic
  resolution down to similar to 0.3 mu m, speeds up to nearly 200 image planes
  per second and the ability to noninvasively acquire hundreds of 3D data
  volumes from single living cells encompassing tens of thousands of image
  frames.
