abstract: Within cells, the spatial compartmentalization of thousands of
  distinct proteins serves a multitude of diverse biochemical needs. Correlative
  super-resolution (SR) fluorescence and electron microscopy (EM) can elucidate
  protein spatial relationships to global ultrastructure, but has suffered from
  tradeoffs of structure preservation, fluorescence retention, resolution, and
  field of view. We developed a platform for three-dimensional cryogenic SR and
  focused ion beam-milled block-face EM across entire vitreously frozen cells.
  The approach preserves ultrastructure while enabling independent SR and EM
  workflow optimization. We discovered unexpected protein-ultrastructure
  relationships in mammalian cells including intranuclear vesicles containing
  endoplasmic reticulum-associated proteins, web-like adhesions between cultured
  neurons, and chromatin domains subclassified on the basis of transcriptional
  activity. Our findings illustrate the value of a comprehensive multimodal view
  of ultrastructural variability across whole cells.
