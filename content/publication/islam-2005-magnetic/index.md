abstract: Magnetic alignment studies demonstrate that a fraction of acid
  purified single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) exhibit both linear-orbital
  (diamagnetic and/or paramagnetic) and ferromagnetic (FM) anisotropies, The
  latter are unexpected, as prior studies have assumed that remaining FM
  impurities are encapsulated and play no role in SWNT alignment. The data imply
  a FM easy axis aligned with the nanotube, permit direct estimates of the FM
  moment size, and provide a more accurate measure of the SWNT.magnetic
  anisotropy. In light of recent observations of FM proximity effects in
  nanotubes, our observation of attached or intrinsic FM anisotropy in these
  systems is an important consideration for future studies of carbon nanotube
  magnetism.
