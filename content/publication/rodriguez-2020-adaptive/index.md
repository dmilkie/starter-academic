  Understanding complex biological systems requires visualizing structures and
  processes deep within living organisms. We developed a compact adaptive optics
  module and incorporated it into two- and three-photon fluorescence
  microscopes, to measure and correct tissue-induced aberrations. We resolved
  synaptic structures in deep cortical and subcortical areas of the mouse brain,
  and demonstrated high-resolution imaging of neuronal structures and
  somatosensory-evoked calcium responses in the mouse spinal cord at
  unprecedented depths in vivo.
