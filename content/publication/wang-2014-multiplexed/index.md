abstract: We describe an adaptive optics method that modulates the intensity or
  phase of light rays at multiple pupil segments in parallel to determine the
  sample-induced aberration. Applicable to fluorescent protein-labeled
  structures of arbitrary complexity, it allowed us to obtain
  diffraction-limited resolution in various samples in vivo. For the strongly
  scattering mouse brain, a single aberration correction improved structural and
  functional imaging of fine neuronal processes over a large imaging volume.
