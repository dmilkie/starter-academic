abstract: Extending three-dimensional (3D) single-molecule localization
  microscopy away from the coverslip and into thicker specimens will greatly
  broaden its biological utility. However, because of the limitations of both
  conventional imaging modalities and conventional labeling techniques, it is a
  challenge to localize molecules in three dimensions with high precision in
  such samples while simultaneously achieving the labeling densities required
  for high resolution of densely crowded structures. Here we combined lattice
  light-sheet microscopy with newly developed, freely diffusing, cell-permeable
  chemical probes with targeted affinity for DNA, intracellular membranes or the
  plasma membrane. We used this combination to perform high-localization
  precision, ultrahigh-labeling density, multicolor localization microscopy in
  samples up to 20 mum thick, including dividing cells and the neuromast organ
  of a zebrafish embryo. We also demonstrate super-resolution correlative
  imaging with protein-specific photoactivable fluorophores, providing a
  mutually compatible, single-platform alternative to correlative light-electron
  microscopy over large volumes.
