abstract: "The magnetic properties of small diameter semiconducting
  single-walled carbon nanotubes have been recently predicted to depend
  sensitively on structural details that can be ignored for larger diameters. We
  confirm this dependence by directly measuring the magnetic alignment of
  several species of carbon nanotubes in aqueous suspension using polarized
  resonant photoluminescence. These data show evidence for asymmetry between
  nanotube chirality subclasses and are used to construct a model predicting
  nanotube magnetic responses for arbitrary semiconducting chirality. "
