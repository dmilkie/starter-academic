abstract: Optical and electron microscopy have made tremendous inroads toward
  understanding the complexity of the brain. However, optical microscopy offers
  insufficient resolution to reveal subcellular details, and electron microscopy
  lacks the throughput and molecular contrast to visualize specific molecular
  constituents over millimeter-scale or larger dimensions. We combined expansion
  microscopy and lattice light-sheet microscopy to image the nanoscale spatial
  relationships between proteins across the thickness of the mouse cortex or the
  entire Drosophila brain. These included synaptic proteins at dendritic spines,
  myelination along axons, and presynaptic densities at dopaminergic neurons in
  every fly brain region. The technology should enable statistically rich,
  large-scale studies of neural development, sexual dimorphism, degree of
  stereotypy, and structural correlations to behavior or neural activity, all
  with molecular contrast.
