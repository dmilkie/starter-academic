abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) identifies spectroscopic signatures of
  intertube transfer of optically pumped carriers in single-walled carbon
  nanotube (SWNT) ensembles. Resonant photoexcitation of large band gap SWNTs
  produces strong PL from smaller band gap SWNTs. Magnetic alignment
  measurements associate the energy-transfer PL peaks with the formation of SWNT
  bundles, suggesting that efficient coupling results from physical contact.
