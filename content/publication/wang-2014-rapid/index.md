abstract: Using a descanned, laser-induced guide star and direct wavefront
  sensing, we demonstrate adaptive correction of complex optical aberrations at
  high numerical aperture (NA) and a 14-ms update rate. This correction permits
  us to compensate for the rapid spatial variation in aberration often
  encountered in biological specimens and to recover diffraction-limited imaging
  over large volumes (>240 mm per side). We applied this to image fine neuronal
  processes and subcellular dynamics within the zebrafish brain.
