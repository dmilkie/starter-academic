abstract: In traditional zonal wavefront sensing for adaptive optics, after
  local wavefront gradients are obtained, the entire wavefront can be calculated
  by assuming that the wavefront is a continuous surface. Such an approach will
  lead to sub-optimal performance in reconstructing wavefronts which are either
  discontinuous or undersampled by the zonal wavefront sensor. Here, we report a
  new method to reconstruct the wavefront by directly measuring local wavefront
  phases in parallel using multidither coherent optical adaptive technique. This
  method determines the relative phases of each pupil segment independently, and
  thus produces an accurate wavefront for even discontinuous wavefronts. We
  implemented this method in an adaptive optical two-photon fluorescence
  microscopy and demonstrated its superior performance in correcting large or
  discontinuous aberrations.
