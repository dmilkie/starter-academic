abstract: We present scanning photoluminescence (PL) microscopy of freely
  suspended single-walled carbon nanotubes grown by chemically assisted vapor
  deposition (CVD) across micron-sized open apertures. Scans of the PL emission
  versus excitation position show unusual "holes" having subwavelength spatial
  features associated with abrupt blue shifts of the emission energy. By varying
  the excitation polarization, energy, intensity, and position, we demonstrate
  that optical switching in some nanotubes is controllable in a highly nonlinear
  manner by adjusting the nonequilibrium carrier density in the nanotube.
  Technologically important attributes include large spectral contrast between
  on/off states at room temperature, a dramatic response to small changes in
  light intensity near threshold, and the possibility that electrical charge
  injection could also be used to control emission energies.
