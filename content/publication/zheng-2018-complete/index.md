abstract: "*Drosophila melanogaster* has a rich repertoire of innate and learned
  behaviors. Its 100,000-neuron brain is a large but tractable target for
  comprehensive neural circuit mapping. Only electron microscopy (EM) enables
  complete, unbiased mapping of synaptic connectivity; however, the fly brain is
  too large for conventional EM. We developed a custom high-throughput EM
  platform and imaged the entire brain of an adult female fly at synaptic
  resolution. To validate the dataset, we traced brain-spanning circuitry
  involving the mushroom body (MB), which has been extensively studied for its
  role in learning. All inputs to Kenyon cells (KCs), the intrinsic neurons of
  the MB, were mapped, revealing a previously unknown cell type, postsynaptic
  partners of KC dendrites, and unexpected clustering of olfactory projection
  neurons. These reconstructions show that this freely available EM volume
  supports mapping of brain-spanning circuits, which will significantly
  accelerate *Drosophila* neuroscience. "
