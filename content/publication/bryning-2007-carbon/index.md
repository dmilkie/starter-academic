abstract: The creation of carbon nanotube (CNT) aerogels from aqueous-gel
  precursors by critical-point-drying and freeze-drying is reported. The CNT
  aerogels are strong and electrically conducting-a potential improvement over
  current technologies for applications such as sensors, electrodes, and
  thermoelectric devices. The aerogels can be reinforced by small amounts of
  poly vinyl alcohol (in the figure the aerogel is supporting 8000 times its own
  weight).
