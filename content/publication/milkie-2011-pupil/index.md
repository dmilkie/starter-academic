abstract: Optical aberrations deteriorate the performance of microscopes.
  Adaptive optics can be used to improve imaging performance via wavefront
  shaping. Here, we demonstrate a pupil-segmentation based adaptive optical
  approach with full-pupil illumination. When implemented in a two-photon
  fluorescence microscope, it recovers diffraction-limited performance and
  improves imaging signal and resolution.
