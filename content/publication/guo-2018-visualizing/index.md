abstract: In eukaryotic cells, organelles and the cytoskeleton undergo highly
  dynamic yet organized interactions capable of orchestrating complex cellular
  functions. Visualizing these interactions requires noninvasive, long-duration
  imaging of the intracellular environment at high spatiotemporal resolution and
  low background. To achieve these normally opposing goals, we developed grazing
  incidence structured illumination microscopy (GI-SIM) that is capable of
  imaging dynamic events near the basal cell cortex at 97-nm resolution and 266
  frames/s over thousands of time points. We employed multi-color GI-SIM to
  characterize the fast dynamic interactions of diverse organelles and the
  cytoskeleton, shedding new light on the complex behaviors of these structures.
  Precise measurements of microtubule growth or shrinkage events helped
  distinguish among models of microtubule dynamic instability. Analysis of
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) interactions with other organelles or microtubules
  uncovered new ER remodeling mechanisms, such as hitchhiking of the ER on
  motile organelles. Finally, ER-mitochondria contact sites were found to
  promote both mitochondria! fission and fusion.
