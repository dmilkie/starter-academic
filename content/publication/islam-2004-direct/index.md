abstract: We determine optical absorption cross sections of single-wall carbon
  nanotubes for visible light copolarized and cross polarized with respect to
  the nanotube axis. The need for perfectly aligned ensembles in absorbance
  measurements is eliminated by using Raman scattering to measure the nematic
  order parameter in magnetically aligned nanotube suspensions. The absorbance
  data allow the first quantitative, spectral comparisons with theories of local
  field depolarization, and provide benchmark spectra for simple, rapid, and
  quantitative measurements of alignment within nanotube dispersions.
