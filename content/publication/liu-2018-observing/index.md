abstract: True physiological imaging of subcellular dynamics requires studying
  cells within their parent organisms, where all the environmental cues that
  drive gene expression, and hence the phenotypes that we actually observe, are
  present. A complete understanding also requires volumetric imaging of the cell
  and its surroundings at high spatiotemporal resolution, without inducing undue
  stress on either. We combined lattice light-sheet microscopy with adaptive
  optics to achieve, across large multicellular volumes, noninvasive
  aberration-free imaging of subcellular processes, including endocytosis,
  organelle remodeling during mitosis, and the migration of axons, immune cells,
  and metastatic cancer cells in vivo. The technology reveals the phenotypic
  diversity within cells across different organisms and developmental stages and
  may offer insights into how cells harness their intrinsic variability to adapt
  to different physiological environments.
